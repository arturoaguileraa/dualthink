This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
3. Add your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here`

Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# or
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
